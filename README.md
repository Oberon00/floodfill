FloodFill
=========

This is a collection of data and script files which, in conjunction with the
[Jade Engine][], form the 2D retro puzzle game FloodFill.

Additionaly included are the sources of some resources, e.g. the tileset is
built from the pngs in tileset-src with the help of scripts also there.

In the distribute directory, there are scripts and additional files for
distributing this game together with the Jade Engine as a ZIP archive and an
InnoSetup installer.
