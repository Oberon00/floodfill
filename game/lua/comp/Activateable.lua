    component module comp.Activateable

    Provides an interface for activateable entities such as levers. Primarly
    intented for interaction with a player-entity.
--]]

local C = component 'ActivateableComponent'

--[[
    Constructor. onActivate (arg#1) should be a function, which should be
    called as a method and with the calling entity as first argument (apart
    from self).
    So when act is an ActivateableComponent, it should look like
        act:activate(callingEntity) (== act.activate(act, callingEntity))
    Don't add new members to ActivateableComponent, this could result in future
    name conflicts. You can, however freely use the data member.

    self.activate = onActivate
    self.data = data or { }
end

function C:cleanup()
    self.activate = nil
    self.data = nil
